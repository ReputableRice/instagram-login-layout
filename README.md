## Description

The login page was created with next.js

- Components:
- Form (Including a useState Array similar to the tutorial)
- Sign up
- App Store Redirect
- Footer

- All images were imported using the next.js Image element

- The login page is responsive to the three states: Desktop, iPad Air, and iPhone XR

*All dimensions were aggregated through a Figma Mockup or the Site itself and changed at my discretion
